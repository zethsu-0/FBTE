            <h4>Beyond Journey's End Arc</h4>
            <p>
              After a ten year's journey, the elven Mage Frieren has defeated
              the Demon King along with the rest of her party - the Hero Himmel,
              the Warrior Eisen, and the Priest Heiter. Fifty years later, after
              the death of the Hero of the party, the long-lived Frieren sets
              out on a journey to Aureole along with her old companions'
              disciples in order to better understand the the meaning and
              emotions behind her companions' fleeting lives and to speak with
              Himmel once again.

                                The Hero Party, consisting of Frieren the Mage
                                and her companions Himmel the Hero, Heiter the
                                Priest, and Eisen the Warrior. They return to
                                the Royal Capital after triumphantly defeating
                                the Demon King. On their way, Himmel suggests
                                that despite their achievements, they still need
                                to seek employment upon their arrival and
                                continue forward with their lives. He tells
                                Frieren that the life ahead of her will be much
                                longer than theirs, which she nonchalantly
                                agrees with. The heroes reach the city amidst a
                                large celebration in their honor and receive
                                recognition from the King.

                                Frieren begins to teach Fern the basics of
                                long-range magic, emphasizing that Fern's mana
                                output and strength will require years of
                                training to master. However, her control over
                                mana, an aspect many mages struggle with, is
                                very high. Over the next four years, Frieren
                                continues to decipher the grimoire while Fern
                                diligently trains under the elf's tutelage and
                                alone in the woods.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                When asked about child's progress by Heiter,
                                Frieren explains that she has learned more than
                                most people would in a decade and that she is
                                studying a little too hard. Suddenly, Heiter
                                collapses, and he later becomes bedridden.
                                Heiter remarks that it is miracle that he had
                                been mobile for so long and Frieren ensures him
                                that she will decipher the grimoire quickly. The
                                elf then tells Fern to pause her training on the
                                cliff to stay by Heiter's side, but Fern rejects
                                this notion, saying that she has to be able to
                                hit the rock with her magic before the priest's
                                death.

                                Twenty-seven years after Hero Himmel's passing,
                                Frieren and Fern find themselves in the trade
                                city of Warm in the Central Lands. As they
                                stroll through the city, Frieren instructs Fern
                                to split up and restock their travel supplies.
                                Fern, realizing most responsibilities fall on
                                her, asks about Frieren's shopping plans.
                                Frieren pauses before responding that she plans
                                on buying herbs and the likes. Reading Frieren's
                                suspicious expression, Fern recalls instances
                                when Frieren purchased a monster's skull, a
                                cloth-dissolving potion that she was told to
                                return, and a book on magical history. Fern
                                hesitates to deem the last item unnecessary.

                                and Fern find themselves at the Granz Channel in

                                villager, they make their way to a neglected
                                beach, a notorious area known for its difficulty
                                to navigate, resulting in numerous shipwrecks
                                over the years. The villager explains that the
                                shore has remained unkempt due to the lack of
                                villagers to assist with the cleanup efforts.

                                Right after the events of the previous episode,
                                Eisen mentions that the mere 10-year journey
                                will be one one-hundredth of Frieren's life as
                                he reminds her of the interaction they had when
                                the party first observed the Era Meteors
                                together. Eisen smiles, finding it funny how a
                                mere one one-hundredth of Frieren's life has
                                changed her as memories of the past to the
                                present begin to flash in Frieren's mind.
                                Frieren and Eisen bid farewell to each other as
                                Frieren and Fern leave. As the two walk, Fern
                                tells Frieren that her time with Frieren so far
                                has taken up half her life. Frieren smiles and
                                tells her that it will be greater than that from
                                now on.

                                Right after the events of the previous episode,
                                Fern asks why Stark still trains if he does not
                                intend to fight the solar dragon. He replies
                                that the villagers think of him as a hero so he
                                must protect the village, although he feels like
                                he will run away. Stark reveals that even the
                                scar on his forehead is something he got when he
                                argued with Eisen over his aversion to fighting
                                monsters, as he was disappointed in him.
                                Ultimately, Stark was never once praised by his
                                master. Fern takes a look at his hand and sees
                                how roughed up it is and understands how hard he
                                has trained.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Fern tells Stark that she does not think he
                                would not run, even though she does not know a
                                single thing about him, because she recalls a
                                fearful experience from when she fought her
                                first monster. She had trained much more than
                                necessary up to that day. However, she was
                                seized by fear and ran, chased by the monster
                                with two heads in a ghoulish expression, and
                                Frieren refused to help her. When she finally
                                resolved herself and turned to face the monster,
                                her body took action on its own, and she
                                successfully defeated it. Fern tells Stark that
                                she believes his resolve to protect the village
                                is genuine, and she leaves him for the night.

                                The Hero Party is depicted walking, having
                                obtained a grimoire purportedly authored by the
                                Great Mage Flamme as a reward for their
                                monster-slaying endeavors. Frieren notes that
                                Flamme-attributed books are usually forgeries,
                                though she remarks that this one is the best
                                imitation she's come across. Himmel fails to
                                grasp the grimoire's value, while Heiter
                                suggests that exposure to constant imitations
                                might lead one to doubt the existence of the
                                real thing. Eisen adds that Flamme, humanity's
                                magic founder, is akin to a fairy tale,
                                prompting Frieren to reflect on time's passage
                                and her being the only one to remember Flamme's
                                face.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                In the present, Frieren wakes up early to Fern's
                                surprise. Fern insists on praising Frieren for
                                waking up early, leading Fern and Stark to
                                indulge her with food and massage, much to
                                Frieren's delight. Twenty-eight years after Hero
                                Himmel's passing, Frieren, Fern, and Stark
                                assist a merchant in clearing a landslide on the
                                Eng Road in the Northern Lands. The merchant
                                expresses gratitude, while Stark questions the
                                necessity of their labor, suggesting they could
                                fly the merchant's cart to the other side.
                                Frieren insists on clearing the blockage for the
                                benefit of future travelers, at least according
                                to Fern, and chides Stark for his perceived
                                selfishness. Stark retorts, refusing to accept
                                criticism from her.

            <h4>Aura the Guillotine Arc</h4>
            <p>
              Twenty-eight years after the Hero Himmel's passing, Frieren's
              Party stops in Graf Granat's Domain during their travels. While
              there, they must confront a group of demons led by one of the
              Seven Sages of Destruction, Aura the Guillotine, in order to save
              the city. After, the Graf tells them that to travel to Ende, they
              must go through the Northern Plateau, which requires a first-class
              mage in the party. The party then decides to head to Äußerst to
              take the First-Class Mage Examination.

                                breaking point, Fern and Stark find their own
                                resolve - and Frieren resumes an old duty.

                                Right after the events of the previous episode,
                                Draht expresses doubt about Frieren's claim of
                                being stronger than not only him but Aura the
                                Guillotine. Draht uses his mana-infused wire
                                magic to hang Frieren by the neck, confident
                                that he has already won. However, Frieren
                                remains unphased, channeling mana around her
                                neck to prevent decapitation. Draht, noting
                                Frieren's calmness, claims that any other mage
                                would have been decapitated before they could
                                react. Believing that he can slice through
                                Frieren's mana, Draht boasts that his wire is
                                among the strongest in demon magic and is
                                impervious to the magic of humankind.

                                Granat expresses his gratitude to Fern and Stark
                                for saving his life, conceding that their
                                companion mage will be forgiven as she had the
                                right judgment about the demons. Stark suggests
                                inviting Frieren back to the town to have her
                                kill the demons, while Fern informs Granat that
                                Frieren was not the one who killed the prison
                                guard. Granat reveals that he already knew the
                                demons were responsible and asks for
                                confirmation that Frieren is the same mage from
                                the Hero Party. Realizing this, he acknowledges
                                that he had acted disrespectfully, given that
                                the Granat family is indebted to the Hero Party
                                for driving demons away from the town during his
                                grandfather's days. Granat reveals that their
                                opponent at the time was the very same Sage of
                                Destruction, Aura the Guillotine.

                              <p>
                                Frieren's many years of training under her
                                teacher Flamme are tested in her confrontation
                                with Aura the Guillotine. Will Aura's scales
                                find her wanting?
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Sometime in the past, Frieren questions her
                                master if she considers their technique unfair,
                                and Flamme reminds Frieren of the true nature of
                                demons, where they use words to deceive humans
                                and are nothing more than monsters that can
                                speak. Flamme justifies that demons don't play
                                fair this way, so they must use techniques that
                                are even more unfair, and she is willing to
                                perform dishonorably if it allows her to
                                eradicate the demons.Lügner lies against a wall
                                after receiving his fatal wound and realizes the
                                bleeding won't stop, signifying his defeat. Fern
                                aims her staff at him and tells him that his
                                plan has failed. He agrees but points out that
                                Frieren will also suffer injuries if she is
                                facing off against Aura, and the Hero Party that
                                had previously forced Aura's army to retreat is
                                no longer there to protect Frieren. He declares
                                that although Frieren poses a threat, she still
                                has less mana than Aura and will lose if they
                                were to fight directly. Fern responds that
                                Frieren will win, as she is not one to directly
                                face a demon and will deceive Aura to defeat
                                her. Lügner thinks of her words as nonsense and
                                recalls his past encounter with Frieren, where
                                she had fought them directly. He feels that
                                something is off and wonders how Fern was able
                                to overwhelm him with attacks without exhausting
                                her mana, given it was so meager and fragile.
                                The realization dawns on him and he wonders if
                                such a technique is possible. He deduces that
                                Frieren must employ the same technique and calls
                                her and Fern a disgrace for using such an unfair
                                approach. Fern replies that Frieren is well
                                aware of the dishonor and blasts Lügner, killing
                                him.

                                journey through the northern lands, but
                                obstacles both natural and manmade still stand
                                in their way.

                                Right after the events of the previous episode,
                                as the sun rises post Aura's defeat, Frieren
                                prays in front of the fallen soldiers who have
                                finally been released from Aura's control. Fern
                                and Stark approach her after arriving at the
                                battlefield via carriage. Fern comments on her
                                victory and joins her prayer. Graf Granat
                                arrives as well and is stunned by Aura's defeat
                                at the hands of Frieren. As Frieren tries to
                                escape with Fern and Stark, Granat tells them
                                that they have no need to leave, and Stark says
                                Frieren that they have been pardoned by the
                                Graf. Granat observes the remains and comments
                                that despite the intensity of the battle, the
                                damage to the fallen warriors was limited. He
                                thanks them for their service towards the fallen
                                heroes of the Northern Lands and Frieren in
                                particular for the respect that she has paid
                                them.

            <h4>Travels to Äußerst Arc</h4>
            <p>
              After departing from Graf Granat's Domain, Frieren's Party travels
              further into the Northern Lands in order to head to their
              destination, Äußerst. Along the way they meet the Priest Sein.
              They convince Sein, who is looking for his friend Warrior Gorilla,
              to join them on their journey so he can search for clues of his
              friend's location. The party continues to journey northwards, now
              with Sein who is able to provide an adult's guidance and support.
              Sein later learns that his friend headed towards Tür, in the
              opposite direction of Äußerst, and he parts ways with a promise to
              meet again.

                                being carried has a flashback of the Hero Party.
                                She remembers shortly how they were at an
                                audience with the bored looking King. Her mind
                                then jump to the old party traveling on the
                                road. Eisen is surprised as the king only gave
                                them ten copper coins for their journey to
                                defeat the Demon King and Frieren complains that
                                he was a cheapskate. Heiter says that it isn't
                                entirely uncalled for, since many have tried but
                                been unsuccessful. Himmel supposes that it isn't
                                so bad, they just have to earn on the way and he
                                feels like going on an adventure with which
                                Heiter agrees. They change the subject when
                                Himmel pulls out his sword and Frieren asks if
                                it is the "Hero's Sword". Heiter says its just a
                                replica. Himmel then tells the story that he
                                saved a merchant from a monster who was visiting
                                his hometown and that he gave the replica to him
                                as a token of gratitude with the words: "For the
                                future hero." Frieren asks if that was why he
                                wanted to become one. Himmel denies and says
                                that he wanted to prove a certain orphan kid
                                named Heiter wrong who said he'd become only a
                                fake hero with a fake sword. Therefore he
                                resolved to become a real hero and acquire the
                                real Hero's sword and defeat the Demon King.
                                With banter, he addresses Heiter as fake priest
                                who only drinks and gets in return from him the
                                reply that he is a real priest. They all laugh
                                and move on, except for Frieren who is
                                speechless and fascinated when Himmel turns back
                                to her with a smile.

                                While passing by a village in the woods of the
                                Northern Lands, Frieren and party meet Sein, a
                                gifted priest who is nonetheless corrupt enough
                                to give even Heiter a run for his money. But
                                what happened in his past?
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Twenty-nine years after the Hero Himmel's
                                passing, Frieren's Party are in the Northern
                                Lands, specifically the Alt Woods. Frieren
                                gathers herbs alone and encounters a man. She
                                sits somewhat interested in the forest listening
                                to the middle-aged man with brown hair from some
                                distance. He comments on her being an adventurer
                                and states he wanted to become one himself a
                                long time ago. However, now it has become a
                                childish dream. Once he had a friend, he says,
                                he had gone on many small adventures with and
                                gets a memory. In a flashback, an energetic
                                young boy that has the manners of a gorilla as
                                the man describes, runs in front of the man also
                                as a young child and both climb a tree to look
                                into the distance. That gorilla-like kid was a
                                good friend of him. The scene changes and the
                                same boys have grown into young adults. The
                                energetic kid with a sword strapped to his back
                                invites the man to become an adventurer. And
                                back in the present, although a decade-old
                                story, the man still has regrets about it and
                                thinks how things would have been different if
                                he had taken his friend's hand.

                                The party arrives in a large and lively town
                                with a bustling shopping district that Frieren
                                once visited with Himmel, but something seems to
                                have come up between Fern and Stark.

                                Twenty-nine years after the Hero Himmel's
                                passing, Frieren's Party are in the Northern
                                Lands, specifically the Raad Region. In a lively
                                town of the region, they see many shops to
                                visit. Frieren recalls being here before with
                                the Hero Party and Heiter looking at the sign of
                                a tavern is pleased. Himmel is in a good mood
                                and asks her to go shopping later which she
                                half-heartedly agrees to do. Back in the present
                                she stops in thought and looks over some houses
                                seeing a clock tower in the distance. Stark
                                calls her and she follows the others.

            <h4>First-Class Mage Exam Arc</h4>
            <p>
              Frieren's Party arrives in Äußerst to take the First-Class Mage
              Examination. The exam is split into three stages. The first stage
              is to capture a mana-sensitive bird called the Stille in the Grobe
              Basin. The exam is conducted in parties of three. Frieren and
              Fern, though split into different parties, both pass the first
              stage of the exam.

                                As the decisive battle draws near, the
                                test-takers form a plan to take on their
                                replicas. How will they overcome each other, and
                                what awaits Frieren in the treasure vault?

                                Fern's attack against Frieren's clone fails, and
                                the clone retaliates by summoning a black hole
                                that encapsulates the surrounding debris,
                                vaporizing it. Frieren continues to defend
                                against various attacks and forms a giant rock
                                golem with more of the remaining debris,
                                enabling both her and the golem to exchange
                                Judradjim charges with her clone from above.
                                Fern flies above and blasts the clone with
                                Zoltraak as it prepares another spell, however
                                the clone is able to defend itself with a sphere
                                of defense magic, which Fern notes. Frieren
                                mentions that they expected it to be capable of
                                performing as so, and the battle is now one of
                                attrition.

                                remains - but first, Frieren and Fern need to
                                settle an important matter in town. What awaits
                                them in the third test?

                                On a cliff overlooking Äußerst, the old man once
                                again tells Stark that he no longer has anything
                                to teach him. The old man departs as Fern
                                approaches, pouting. Stark learns that Fern had
                                another fight with Frieren and asks if they
                                should be arguing given that the third stage of
                                the First-Class Mage Exam is soon. Fern answers
                                that Frieren had been especially unsympathetic
                                this time, as she told Fern to simply buy a new
                                staff rather than try and repair her original
                                one—a gift from Heiter and something she would
                                never consider replacing—after it broke in the
                                Ruins of the King's Tomb. Stark tries to
                                convince Fern that given Frieren's personality,
                                she likely didn't mean what she said. In
                                Äußerst, Lawine sulks to Kanne after failing the
                                second stage. Kanne offers to pat her head for
                                comfort, and she accepts. They notice Frieren
                                passing by with a bag, and Frieren shows them
                                its contents, consisting of the broken pieces of
                                Fern's staff.
